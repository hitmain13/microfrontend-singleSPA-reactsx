# microfrontend-singleSPA-reactsx

This a little example of a Micro-frontend using Single SPA framework that will allow you work with multiple frontend frameworks such as React + Angular + VueJS in the same webpage.

The example that will be used is found in my another repository (Jamestip challenge). We will transform the monolite frontend structure to a modern and modulated frontend structure.

It's not finished. Coming soon... Last update: 30/jun/2022.

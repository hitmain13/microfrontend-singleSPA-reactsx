# microfrontend-singleSPA-reactsx

This a little example of a Micro-frontend using Single SPA framework that will allow you work with multiple frontend frameworks such as React + Angular + VueJS in the same webpage.

The example that will be used is found in my another repository (Jamestip challenge). We will transform the monolite frontend structure to a modern and modulated frontend structure.

It's not finished. Coming soon... Last update: 30/jun/2022.

How does it work? 

Every single-spa application must to have a root repo which contains all the resources and node_modules necessary to build the application.

A single-spa application doesn't need to have a index HTML. Because of this, the root folder is wrapped to your application and will provide the necessary routes to your components aplication. 

In index.ejs file you can configure your importmaps of your modules. According your application is growing, you can add new module using any Javascript framework such Angular, React and VueJS.

That's why you will be able to work with multiples frameworks. Each modules can have a different development team. Each modules can have components that can be reused any time.
